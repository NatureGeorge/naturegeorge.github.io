This is ZZF (朱泽峰). I am a first year Ph.D. student in AAIS at Peking University.

My involvement in science lies in the study of biomacromolecule structure.
I am passionate to explore the underlying mechanisms of the molecular world with mathematical tools and physical insights.
And I am stepping toward utilizing the advantages of (deep) learning methods to build a physically interpretable model of protein folding, conformation changes, protein binding, and so on.
