## Backgrounds

The biopolymers such as proteins, RNA, and DNA are composed of a finite set of basic building blocks linked with covalent bonds forming a sequential order. Their native states are often involved with intra-molecular non-covalent interactions <d-footnote>except that some residues would form covalent disulfide bonds </d-footnote>toward low-energy conformations. <d-footnote>Not to mention those high energy states and interactions with partners and solvent molecules for now. </d-footnote>People have come up with many ways to describe those interactions. The concept of "interaction" itself has sound mathematical formulations, and the **genus** is such a quantitative measurement. And we can apply it to analyze the topological properties of biomolecular structures.

## Euler Formula (Euler Characteristic)

$$
b − n = 2 − 2g − r
$$
