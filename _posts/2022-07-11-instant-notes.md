## Protein Comparison & Search

### Protein Structure Comparison

Applications of the Gauss Integrals on protein structure comparison considering self-intersections and self-avoiding morphs, proposed by Peter RÃ¸gen<d-cite key="PR2021"></d-cite><d-cite key="PR2003"></d-cite>.

### Protein Structure Search

Kempen et al. developed a new approach to perform a fast protein structure search by discretizing the tertiary interactions into structural alphabets learned by VQ-VAE<d-cite key="vanKempen2022"></d-cite>,

however not mention the related works utilizing the 3D Zernike polynomials and supporting oligomeric query<d-cite key="Guzenko2020"></d-cite>.

For discretizing tertiary interactions, there are also some related works<d-cite key="Jure2022"></d-cite>.

### New Sequence Alignment

Inspired by the field of protein structure contact prediction, particularly the Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) methodology, Talibart et al. applied the Potts model considering direct couplings (i.e. coevolution) between positions in addition to positional composition (i.e. positional conservation) to align two sequences through aligning two Potts models inferred from corresponding multiple sequence alignments (MSA) via Integer Linear Programming (ILP)<d-cite key="Talibart2021"></d-cite>. Their model can be used to improve the alignment of remotely related protein sequences in tractable time. Following this idea, it is straightforward to utilize the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)<d-cite key="Monasson2019"></d-cite> and even deep neural networks to build theoretically more powerful models.

Interestingly, Petti et al. recently proposed another (similar in idea but quite different in implementation) approach to perform multiple sequence alignment<d-cite key="Petti2021"></d-cite>. They implemented a smooth and differentiable version of the Smith-Waterman pairwise alignment algorithm via differentiable dynamic programming and designed a method called Smooth Markov Unaligned Random Field (SMURF) that takes as input unaligned sequences and jointly learns the MSA. And they proved that such a differentiable alignment module helps improve the structure prediction results over those initial MSAs.

## AlphaFold2 & RoseTTAFold Downstream Analysis

### New Fold?

Bordin et al. reported a new CATH-Assign protocol which is used to analyze the AlphaFoldDB and detect new superfamilies<d-cite key="Bordin2022"></d-cite>. It seems that AlphaFold2 yields a certain amount of "novel" structures. But people should be cautious about this since the predicted structures are not always "true".

### Predicting the Impact of Mutations

Sen et al. used both AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold to predict the structures of protein domains without known experimental structures, and perform subsequent functional predictions based on those predicted structures to help estimate the effect of disease-associated missense mutations<d-cite key="Sen2022"></d-cite>. Such incorporating two models to try to yield better results is a kind of ensemble approach.

## Toolbox

* The structural bioinformatics library (SBL)<d-cite key="Cazals2016"></d-cite>
* iBIS2Analyzer: a web server for a phylogeny-driven coevolution analysis of protein families<d-cite key="Oteri2022"></d-cite>

Require further investigation for usability.
