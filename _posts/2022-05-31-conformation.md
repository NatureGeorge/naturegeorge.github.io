When we look at a static covalent-bonded protein conformation, we focus on the backbone torsion trace and the side-chain rotamers. All the non-covalent interactions and the hydrophobic effect are implicit but typically explicitly evaluated through interatomic Euclidean distances.
In other words, this naive representation requires further augmentation of descriptions of non-covalent interactions.

When movement involves, protein conformation becomes live. And the movements are characteristically described by the torsional DoF of backbone and side-chains. However, these DoF are restrained by the interatomic interactions rather than freely going around the whole space. Interactions related to solvent molecules, ligands, and binding partners should also be taken into account. Conformations without significant backbone movements are considered to be in the same conformation ensemble and trapped in the same low-energy state. On the contrary, critical movements of the backbone are the transition process between different low-energy states.

Systematic descriptions of the energy landscapes help us to quantify conformations and their changes.
