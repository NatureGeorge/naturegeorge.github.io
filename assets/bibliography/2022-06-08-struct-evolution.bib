  abstract = {Procrustes analysis involves finding the optimal superposition of two or more “forms” via rotations, translations, and scalings. Procrustes problems arise in a wide range of scientific disciplines, especially when the geometrical shapes of objects are compared, contrasted, and analyzed. Classically, the optimal transformations are found by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between corresponding points in the forms. Despite its widespread use, the ordinary unweighted least-squares (LS) criterion can give erroneous solutions when the errors have heterogeneous variances (heteroscedasticity) or the errors are correlated, both common occurrences with real data. In contrast, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation can provide accurate and consistent statistical estimates in the presence of both heteroscedasticity and correlation. Here we provide a complete solution to the nonisotropic ML Procrustes problem assuming a matrix Gaussian distribution with factored covariances. Our analysis generalizes, simplifies, and extends results from previous discussions of the ML Procrustes problem. An iterative algorithm is presented for the simultaneous, numerical determination of the ML solutions.}

  abstract = {{Summary: THESEUS is a command line program for performing maximum likelihood (ML) superpositions and analysis of macromolecular structures. While conventional superpositioning methods use ordinary least-squares (LS) as the optimization criterion, ML superpositions provide substantially improved accuracy by down-weighting variable structural regions and by correcting for correlations among atoms. ML superpositioning is robust and insensitive to the specific atoms included in the analysis, and thus it does not require subjective pruning of selected variable atomic coordinates. Output includes both likelihood-based and frequentist statistics for accurate evaluation of the adequacy of a superposition and for reliable analysis of structural similarities and differences. THESEUS performs principal components analysis for analyzing the complex correlations found among atoms within a structural ensemble.Availability: ANSI C source code and selected binaries for various computing platforms are available under the GNU open source license from  or Contact:douglas.theobald@colorado.eduSupplementary Information: Supplementary data including details of the ML superpositioning algorithm are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

  abstract  = {The cores of globular proteins are densely packed, resulting in complicated networks of structural interactions. These interactions in turn give rise to dynamic structural correlations over a wide range of time scales. Accurate analysis of these complex correlations is crucial for understanding biomolecular mechanisms and for relating structure to function. Here we report a highly accurate technique for inferring the major modes of structural correlation in macromolecules using likelihood-based statistical analysis of sets of structures. This method is generally applicable to any ensemble of related molecules, including families of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) models, different crystal forms of a protein, and structural alignments of homologous proteins, as well as molecular dynamics trajectories. Dominant modes of structural correlation are determined using principal components analysis (PCA) of the maximum likelihood estimate of the correlation matrix. The correlations we identify are inherently independent of the statistical uncertainty and dynamic heterogeneity associated with the structural coordinates. We additionally present an easily interpretable method (“PCA plots”) for displaying these positional correlations by color-coding them onto a macromolecular structure. Maximum likelihood PCA of structural superpositions, and the structural PCA plots that illustrate the results, will facilitate the accurate determination of dynamic structural correlations analyzed in diverse fields of structural biology.},

  abstract = {{Motivation: Superpositioning is an essential technique in structural biology that facilitates the comparison and analysis of conformational differences among topologically similar structures. Performing a superposition requires a one-to-one correspondence, or alignment, of the point sets in the different structures. However, in practice, some points are usually ‘missing’ from several structures, for example, when the alignment contains gaps. Current superposition methods deal with missing data simply by superpositioning a subset of points that are shared among all the structures. This practice is inefficient, as it ignores important data, and it fails to satisfy the common least-squares criterion. In the extreme, disregarding missing positions prohibits the calculation of a superposition altogether.Results: Here, we present a general solution for determining an optimal superposition when some of the data are missing. We use the expectation–maximization algorithm, a classic statistical technique for dealing with incomplete data, to find both maximum-likelihood solutions and the optimal least-squares solution as a special case.Availability and implementation: The methods presented here are implemented in THESEUS 2.0, a program for superpositioning macromolecular structures.

  abstract = {Abstract Proteins evolve under a myriad of biophysical selection pressures that collectively control the patterns of amino acid substitutions. These evolutionary pressures are sufficiently consistent over time and across protein families to produce substitution patterns, summarized in global amino acid substitution matrices such as BLOSUM, JTT, WAG, and LG, which can be used to successfully detect homologs, infer phylogenies, and reconstruct ancestral sequences. Although the factors that govern the variation of amino acid substitution rates have received much attention, the influence of thermodynamic stability constraints remains unresolved. Here we develop a simple model to calculate amino acid substitution matrices from evolutionary dynamics controlled by a fitness function that reports on the thermodynamic effects of amino acid mutations in protein structures. This hybrid biophysical and evolutionary model accounts for nucleotide transition/transversion rate bias, multi-nucleotide codon changes, the number of codons per amino acid, and thermodynamic protein stability. We find that our theoretical model accurately recapitulates the complex yet universal pattern observed in common global amino acid substitution matrices used in phylogenetics. These results suggest that selection for thermodynamically stable proteins, coupled with nucleotide mutation bias filtered by the structure of the genetic code, is the primary driver behind the global amino acid substitution patterns observed in proteins throughout the tree of life.},

  abstract  = {Superpositioning plays a fundamental role in current macromolecular structural analysis. By orienting structures so that their atoms match closely, superpositioning enables the direct analysis of conformational similarities and differences in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Superpositioning is a special case of Procrustes problems, in which coordinate vector sets are optimally oriented via rigid body rotations and translations. Optimal transformations are conventionally determined by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between corresponding atoms in the structures. However, the ordinary unweighted least-squares (OLS) criterion can produce inaccurate results when the atoms have heterogeneous variances (heteroscedasticity) or the atomic positions are correlated, both of which are common features of real data. In contrast, model-based probabilistic methods can easily allow for heterogeneous variances and correlations. Our likelihood treatment of the superposition problem results in more accurate superpositions and provides a framework for a full Bayesian analysis.},
