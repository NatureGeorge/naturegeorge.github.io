  abstract = {Summary A fundamental problem in bioinformatics is to characterize the secondary structure of a protein, which has traditionally been carried out by examining a scatterplot (Ramachandran plot) of the conformational angles. We examine two natural bivariate von Mises distributions—referred to as Sine and Cosine models—which have five parameters and, for concentrated data, tend to a bivariate normal distribution. These are analyzed and their main properties derived. Conditions on the parameters are established which result in bimodal behavior for the joint density and the marginal distribution, and we note an interesting situation in which the joint density is bimodal but the marginal distributions are unimodal. We carry out comparisons of the two models, and it is seen that the Cosine model may be preferred. Mixture distributions of the Cosine model are fitted to two representative protein datasets using the expectation maximization algorithm, which results in an objective partition of the scatterplot into a number of components. Our results are consistent with empirical observations; new insights are discussed.},

  abstract = {Despite significant progress in recent years, protein structure prediction maintains its status as one of the prime unsolved problems in computational biology. One of the key remaining challenges is an efficient probabilistic exploration of the structural space that correctly reflects the relative conformational stabilities. Here, we present a fully probabilistic, continuous model of local protein structure in atomic detail. The generative model makes efficient conformational sampling possible and provides a framework for the rigorous analysis of local sequence–structure correlations in the native state. Our method represents a significant theoretical and practical improvement over the widely used fragment assembly technique by avoiding the drawbacks associated with a discrete and nonprobabilistic approach.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT We propose a method to formulate probabilistic models of protein structure in atomic detail, for a given amino acid sequence, based on Bayesian principles, while retaining a close link to physics. We start from two previously developed probabilistic models of protein structure on a local length scale, which concern the dihedral angles in main chain and side chains, respectively. Conceptually, this constitutes a probabilistic and continuous alternative to the use of discrete fragment and rotamer libraries. The local model is combined with a nonlocal model that involves a small number of energy terms according to a physical force field, and some information on the overall secondary structure content. In this initial study we focus on the formulation of the joint model and the evaluation of the use of an energy vector as a descriptor of a protein's nonlocal structure; hence, we derive the parameters of the nonlocal model from the native structure without loss of generality. The local and nonlocal models are combined using the reference ratio method, which is a well-justified probabilistic construction. For evaluation, we use the resulting joint models to predict the structure of four proteins. The results indicate that the proposed method and the probabilistic models show considerable promise for probabilistic protein structure prediction and related applications.

  abstract  = {Summary Proteins are biomolecules that are of great importance in science, biotechnology and medicine. Their function relies heavily on their three-dimensional shape, which in turn follows from their amino acid sequence. Therefore, there is great interest in modelling the three-dimensional structure of proteins in silico given their sequence. We discuss the formulation of a tractable probabilistic model of protein structure that features atomic detail and can be used for protein structure prediction. The model unites dynamic Bayesian networks and directional statistics to cover the short-range features of proteins. Long-range features are added by making use of probability kinematics – a little known variant of Bayesian belief updating first proposed by the probability theorist Richard Jeffrey in the 1950s. The method we describe can be generalized to formulate tractable probabilistic models that involve high dimensionality and need to cover multiple scales}

  abstract = {{Recently described stochastic models of protein evolution have demonstrated that the inclusion of structural information in addition to amino acid sequences leads to a more reliable estimation of evolutionary parameters. We present a generative, evolutionary model of protein structure and sequence that is valid on a local length scale. The model concerns the local dependencies between sequence and structure evolution in a pair of homologous proteins. The evolutionary trajectory between the two structures in the protein pair is treated as a random walk in dihedral angle space, which is modeled using a novel angular diffusion process on the two-dimensional torus. Coupling sequence and structure evolution in our model allows for modeling both “smooth” conformational changes and “catastrophic” conformational jumps, conditioned on the amino acid changes. The model has interpretable parameters and is comparatively more realistic than previous stochastic models, providing new insights into the relationship between sequence and structure evolution. For example, using the trained model we were able to identify an apparent sequence–structure evolutionary motif present in a large number of homologous protein pairs. The generative nature of our model enables us to evaluate its validity and its ability to simulate aspects of protein evolution conditioned on an amino acid sequence, a related amino acid sequence, a related structure or any combination thereof.}},

  abstract = {We introduce stochastic models for continuous-time evolution of angles and develop their estimation. We focus on studying Langevin diffusions with stationary distributions equal to well-known distributions from directional statistics, since such diffusions can be regarded as toroidal analogues of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. Their likelihood function is a product of transition densities with no analytical expression, but that can be calculated by solving the Fokker--Planck equation numerically through adequate schemes. We propose three approximate likelihoods that are computationally tractable: (i) a likelihood based on the stationary distribution; (ii) toroidal adaptations of the Euler and Shoji--Ozaki pseudo-likelihoods; (iii) a likelihood based on a specific approximation to the transition density of the wrapped normal process. A simulation study compares, in dimensions one and two, the approximate transition densities to the exact ones, and investigates the empirical performance of the approximate likelihoods. Finally, two diffusions are used to model the evolution of the backbone angles of the protein G (PDB identifier 1GB1) during a molecular dynamics simulation. The software package sdetorus implements the estimation methods and applications presented in the paper.},

  abstract = {{In the bioinformatics field, there has been a growing interest in modeling dihedral angles of amino acids by viewing them as data on the torus. This has motivated, over the past years, new proposals of distributions on the torus. The main drawback of most of these models is that the related densities are (pointwise) symmetric, despite the fact that the data usually present asymmetric patterns. This motivates the need to find a new way of constructing asymmetric toroidal distributions starting from a symmetric distribution. We tackle this problem in this article by introducing the sine-skewed toroidal distributions. The general properties of the new models are derived. Based on the initial symmetric model, explicit expressions for the shape and dependence measures are obtained, a simple algorithm for generating random numbers is provided, and asymptotic results for the maximum likelihood estimators are established. An important feature of our construction is that no extra normalizing constant needs to be calculated, leading to more flexible distributions without increasing the complexity of the models. The benefit of employing these new sine-skewed toroidal distributions is shown on the basis of protein data, where, in general, the new models outperform their symmetric antecedents.}},

  abstract = {For three decades now, knowledge-based scoring functions that operate through the “potential of mean force” (PMF) approach have continuously proven useful for studying protein structures. Although these statistical potentials are not to be confused with their physics-based counterparts of the same name—i.e. PMFs obtained by molecular dynamics simulations—their particular success in assessing the native-like character of protein structure predictions has lead authors to consider the computed scores as approximations of the free energy. However, this physical justification is a matter of controversy since the beginning. Alternative interpretations based on Bayes’ theorem have been proposed, but the misleading formalism that invokes the inverse Boltzmann law remains recurrent in the literature. In this article, we present a conceptually new method for ranking protein structure models by quality, which is (i) independent of any physics-based explanation and (ii) relevant to statistics and to a general definition of information gain. The theoretical development described in this study provides new insights into how statistical PMFs work, in comparison with our approach. To prove the concept, we have built interatomic distance-dependent scoring functions, based on the former and new equations, and compared their performance on an independent benchmark of 60,000 protein structures. The results demonstrate that our new formalism outperforms statistical PMFs in evaluating the quality of protein structural decoys. Therefore, this original type of score offers a possibility to improve the success of statistical PMFs in the various fields of structural biology where they are applied.
