  abstract = {{The ‘Genus for biomolecules’ database (http://genus.fuw.edu.pl) collects information about topological structure and complexity of proteins and RNA chains, which is captured by the genus of a given chain and its subchains. For each biomolecule, this information is shown in the form of a genus trace plot, as well as a genus matrix diagram. We assemble such information for all and RNA structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This database presents also various statistics and extensive information about the biological function of the analyzed biomolecules. The database is regularly self-updating, once new structures are deposited in the PDB. Moreover, users can analyze their own structures.}},
