Structure comparison is, e.g., algorithmically the starting point for computational studies of structural evolution and it guides our efforts to predict protein structures from their amino acid sequences. Most methods for structural alignment of protein structures optimize the distances between aligned and superimposed residue pairs, i.e., the distances traveled by the aligned and superimposed residues during linear interpolation. Considering such a linear interpolation, these methods do not differentiate if there is room for the interpolation, if it causes steric clashes, or more severely, if it changes the topology of the compared protein backbone curves.},

  abstract = {We introduce a method of looking at, analyzing, and comparing protein structures. The topology of a protein is captured by 30 numbers inspired by Vassiliev knot invariants. To illustrate the simplicity and power of this topological approach, we construct a measure (scaled Gauss metric, SGM) of similarity of protein shapes. Under this metric, protein chains naturally separate into fold clusters. We use SGM to construct an automatic classification procedure for the CATH2.4 database. The method is very fast because it requires neither alignment of the chains nor any chain–chain comparison. It also has only one adjustable parameter. We assign 95.51\% of the chains into the proper C (class), A (architecture), T (topology), and H (homologous superfamily) fold, find all new folds, and detect no false geometric positives. Using the SGM, we display a “map” of the space of folds projected onto two dimensions, show the relative locations of the major structural classes, and “zoom into” the space of proteins to show architecture, topology, and fold clusters. The existence of a simple measure of a protein fold computed from the chain path will have a major impact on automatic fold classification.}

Comparisons are usually performed at the polypeptide chain level, however the functional form of a protein within the cell is often an oligomer. This fact, together with recent growth of oligomeric structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), demands more efficient approaches to oligomeric assembly alignment/retrieval. Traditional methods use atom level information, which can be complicated by the presence of topological permutations within a polypeptide chain and/or subunit rearrangements. These challenges can be overcome by comparing electron density volumes directly. But, brute force alignment of 3D data is a compute intensive search problem. We developed a 3D Zernike moment normalization procedure to orient electron density volumes and assess similarity with unprecedented speed. Similarity searching with this approach enables real-time retrieval of proteins/protein assemblies resembling a target, from PDB or user input, together with resulting alignments (http://shape.rcsb.org).},

The idea is to represent the pairwise distances of any two residues of the structure in a 2D distance matrix (DM). Features and/or submatrices are extracted from this DM to represent a domain. Existing approaches, however, may involve a large number of features (100–400) or complicated mathematical operations. Finding fewer but more effective features is always desirable. In this paper, based on some key observations on DMs, we are able to decompose a DM image into four basic binary images, each representing the structural characteristics of a fundamental secondary structure element (SSE) or a motif in the domain. Using the concept of moments in image processing, we further derive 45 structural features based on the four binary images. Together with 4 features extracted from the basic images, we represent the structure of a domain using 49 features. We show that our feature vectors can represent domain structures effectively in terms of the following. (1) We show a higher accuracy for domain classification. (2) We show a clear and consistent distribution of domains using our proposed structural vector space. (3) We are able to cluster the domains according to our moment features and demonstrate a relationship between structural variation and functional diversity.},

  abstract  = {3D protein structures can be analyzed using a distance matrix calculated as the pairwise distance between all Cα atoms in the protein model. Although researchers have efficiently used distance matrices to classify proteins and find homologous proteins, much less work has been done on quantitative analysis of distance matrix features. Therefore, the distance matrix was analyzed as gray scale image using KAZE feature extractor algorithm with Bag of Visual Words model. In this study, each protein was represented as a histogram of visual codewords. The analysis showed that a very small number of codewords (~1%) have a high relative frequency (> 0.25) and that the majority of codewords have a relative frequency around 0.05. We have also shown that there is a relationship between the frequency of codewords and the position of the features in a distance matrix. The codewords that are more frequent are located closer to the main diagonal. Less frequent codewords, on the other hand, are located in the corners of the distance matrix, far from the main diagonal. Moreover, the analysis showed a correlation between the number of unique codewords and the 3D repeats in the protein structure. The solenoid and tandem repeats proteins have a significantly lower number of unique codewords than the globular proteins. Finally, the codeword histograms and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier were used to classify solenoid and globular proteins. The result showed that the SVM classifier fed with codeword histograms correctly classified 352 out of 354 proteins.},

  abstract = {We question a central paradigm: namely, that the protein domain is the “atomic unit” of evolution. In conflict with the current textbook view, our results unequivocally show that duplication of protein segments happens both above and below the domain level among amino acid segments of diverse lengths. Indeed, we show that significant evolutionary information is lost when the protein is approached as a string of domains. Our finer-grained approach reveals a far more complicated picture, where reused segments often intertwine and overlap with each other. Our results are consistent with a recursive model of evolution, in which segments of various lengths, typically smaller than domains, “hop” between environments. The fit segments remain, leaving traces that can still be detected. Proteins share similar segments with one another. Such “reused parts”—which have been successfully incorporated into other proteins—are likely to offer an evolutionary advantage over de novo evolved segments, as most of the latter will not even have the capacity to fold. To systematically explore the evolutionary traces of segment “reuse” across proteins, we developed an automated methodology that identifies reused segments from protein alignments. We search for “themes”—segments of at least 35 residues of similar sequence and structure—reused within representative sets of 15,016 domains [Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) database] or 20,398 chains [Protein Data Bank (PDB)]. We observe that theme reuse is highly prevalent and that reuse is more extensive when the length threshold for identifying a theme is lower. Structural domains, the best characterized form of reuse in proteins, are just one of many complex and intertwined evolutionary traces. Others include long themes shared among a few proteins, which encompass and overlap with shorter themes that recur in numerous proteins. The observed complexity is consistent with evolution by duplication and divergence, and some of the themes might include descendants of ancestral segments. The observed recursive footprints, where the same amino acid can simultaneously participate in several intertwined themes, could be a useful concept for protein design.

  abstract = {Proteins fold into intricate 3D structures, determined by their amino acid sequences. Different proteins can fold into drastically different structures, and the space of all possible structures appears hopelessly complex. However, this is precisely the space that needs to be described to understand how sequence encodes structure. In this paper, we decompose the set of known protein structures into standard reusable building blocks, which we call tertiary structural motifs (TERMs). Strikingly, we find that only ∼600 TERMs describe 50\% of the known protein structural universe at sub-Angstrom resolution. Furthermore, we find the natural utilization of TERMs gives us a means of uncovering sequence–structure relationships. These insights can be harnessed for protein structure prediction, protein design, and other applications. Here, we systematically decompose the known protein structural universe into its basic elements, which we dub tertiary structural motifs (TERMs). A TERM is a compact backbone fragment that captures the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary environments around a given residue, comprising one or more disjoint segments (three on average). We seek the set of universal TERMs that capture all structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), finding remarkable degeneracy. Only ∼600 TERMs are sufficient to describe 50\% of the PDB at sub-Angstrom resolution. However, more rare geometries also exist, and the overall structural coverage grows logarithmically with the number of TERMs. We go on to show that universal TERMs provide an effective mapping between sequence and structure. We demonstrate that TERM-based statistics alone are sufficient to recapitulate close-to-native sequences given either NMR or X-ray backbones. Furthermore, sequence variability predicted from TERM data agrees closely with evolutionary variation. Finally, locations of TERMs in protein chains can be predicted from sequence alone based on sequence signatures emergent from TERM instances in the PDB. For multisegment motifs, this method identifies spatially adjacent fragments that are not contiguous in sequence—a major bottleneck in structure prediction. Although all TERMs recur in diverse proteins, some appear specialized for certain functions, such as interface formation, metal coordination, or even water binding. Structural biology has benefited greatly from previously observed degeneracies in structure. The decomposition of the known structural universe into a finite set of compact TERMs offers exciting opportunities toward better understanding, design, and prediction of protein structure.}

  abstract = {Evolution has given us proteins that perform amazingly complex tasks in living systems, each molecule appearing “custom-built” for its particular purpose. Protein design seeks to enable the “custom building” of proteins at will, for specific tasks, without waiting for evolution. This is a grand challenge, because how a protein’s 3-dimensional structure and function are encoded in its amino acid sequence is exceedingly difficult to model. In this paper, we argue that sequence–structure encodings can instead be learned directly from proteins of known structure, which enables an approach to design. We are at an exciting time in protein science, where emergent principles inferred from data may allow us to make headway in cases where application of first principles is challenging. Current state-of-the-art approaches to computational protein design (CPD) aim to capture the determinants of structure from physical principles. While this has led to many successful designs, it does have strong limitations associated with inaccuracies in physical modeling, such that a reliable general solution to CPD has yet to be found. Here, we propose a design framework—one based on identifying and applying patterns of sequence–structure compatibility found in known proteins, rather than approximating them from models of interatomic interactions. We carry out extensive computational analyses and an experimental validation for our method. Our results strongly argue that the Protein Data Bank is now sufficiently large to enable proteins to be designed by using only examples of structural motifs from unrelated proteins. Because our method is likely to have orthogonal strengths relative to existing techniques, it could represent an important step toward removing remaining barriers to robust CPD.}

  abstract = {Abstract By using an unsupervised cluster analyzer, we have identified a local structural alphabet composed of 16 folding patterns of five consecutive Cα (“protein blocks”). The dependence that exists between successive blocks is explicitly taken into account. A Bayesian approach based on the relation protein block-amino acid propensity is used for prediction and leads to a success rate close to 35\%. Sharing sequence windows associated with certain blocks into “sequence families” improves the prediction accuracy by 6\%. This prediction accuracy exceeds 75\% when keeping the first four predicted protein blocks at each site of the protein. In addition, two different strategies are proposed: the first one defines the number of protein blocks in each site needed for respecting a user-fixed prediction accuracy, and alternatively, the second one defines the different protein sites to be predicted with a user-fixed number of blocks and a chosen accuracy. This last strategy applied to the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (α/β protein) shows that 91\% of the sites may be predicted with a prediction accuracy larger than 77\% considering only three blocks per site. The prediction strategies proposed improve our knowledge about sequence-structure dependence and should be very useful in ab initio protein modelling.

In addition, we use RBM to design new protein sequences with putative properties by composing and 'turning up' or 'turning down' the different modes at will.

Despite their importance for many downstream tasks, such as structure prediction, MSA generation is often treated as a separate pre-processing step, without any guidance from the application it will be used for. Here, we implement a smooth and differentiable version of the Smith-Waterman pairwise alignment algorithm that enables jointly learning an MSA and a downstream machine learning system in an end-to-end fashion. To demonstrate its utility, we introduce SMURF (Smooth Markov Unaligned Random Field), a new method that jointly learns an alignment and the parameters of a Markov Random Field for unsupervised contact prediction. We find that SMURF learns MSAs that mildly improve contact prediction on a diverse set of protein and RNA families. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by connecting our differentiable alignment module to AlphaFold and maximizing predicted confidence, we can learn MSAs that improve structure predictions over the initial MSAs. Interestingly, the alignments that improve AlphaFold predictions are self-inconsistent and can be viewed as adversarial. This work highlights the potential of differentiable dynamic programming to improve neural network pipelines that rely on an alignment and the potential dangers of relying on black-box methods for optimizing predictions of protein sequences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract     = {Over the last year, there have been substantial improvements in protein structure prediction, particularly in methods like DeepMind{\textquoteright}s AlphaFold2 (AF2) that exploit deep learning strategies. Here we report a new CATH-Assign protocol which is used to analyse the first tranche of AF2 models predicted for 21 model organisms and discuss insights these models bring on the nature of protein structure space. We analyse good quality models and those with no unusual structural characteristics, i.e., features rarely seen in experimental structures. For the \~{}370,000 models that meet these criteria, we observe that 92\% can be assigned to evolutionary superfamilies in CATH. The remaining domains cluster into 2,367 putative novel superfamilies. Detailed manual analysis on a subset of 618 of those which had at least one human relative revealed some extremely remote homologies and some further unusual features, but 26 could be confirmed as novel superfamilies and one of these has an alpha-beta propeller architectural arrangement never seen before. By clustering both experimental and predicted AF2 domain structures into distinct {\textquoteleft}global fold{\textquoteright} groups, we observe that the new AF2 models in CATH increase information on structural diversity by 36\%. This expansion in structural diversity will help to reveal associated functional diversity not previously detected. Our novel CATH-Assign protocol scales well and will be able to harness the huge expansion (at least 100 million models) in structural data promised by DeepMind to provide more comprehensive coverage of even the most diverse superfamilies to help rationalise evolutionary changes in their functions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {{Mutations in human proteins lead to diseases. The structure of these proteins can help understand the mechanism of such diseases and develop therapeutics against them. With improved deep learning techniques, such as RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold, we can predict the structure of proteins even in the absence of structural homologs. We modeled and extracted the domains from 553 disease-associated human proteins without known protein structures or close homologs in the Protein Databank. We noticed that the model quality was higher and the Root mean square deviation (RMSD) lower between AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold models for domains that could be assigned to CATH families as compared to those which could only be assigned to Pfam families of unknown structure or could not be assigned to either. We predicted ligand-binding sites, protein–protein interfaces and conserved residues in these predicted structures. We then explored whether the disease-associated missense mutations were in the proximity of these predicted functional sites, whether they destabilized the protein structure based on ddG calculations or whether they were predicted to be pathogenic. We could explain 80\\% of these disease-associated mutations based on proximity to functional sites, structural destabilization or pathogenicity. When compared to polymorphisms, a larger percentage of disease-associated missense mutations were buried, closer to predicted functional sites, predicted as destabilizing and pathogenic. Usage of models from the two state-of-the-art techniques provide better confidence in our predictions, and we explain 93 additional mutations based on RoseTTAFold models which could not be explained based solely on AlphaFold models.}},

  abstract = {{Software in structural bioinformatics has mainly been application driven. To favor practitioners seeking off-the-shelf applications, but also developers seeking advanced building blocks to develop novel applications, we undertook the design of the Structural Bioinformatics Library (SBL, http://sbl.inria.fr), a generic C ++/python cross-platform software library targeting complex problems in structural bioinformatics. Its tenet is based on a modular design offering a rich and versatile framework allowing the development of novel applications requiring well specified complex operations, without compromising robustness and performances.The SBL involves four software components (1–4 thereafter). For end-users, the SBL provides ready to use, state-of-the-art (1) applications to handle molecular models defined by unions of balls, to deal with molecular flexibility, to model macro-molecular assemblies. These applications can also be combined to tackle integrated analysis problems. For developers, the SBL provides a broad C ++ toolbox with modular design, involving core (2) algorithms, (3) biophysical models and (4) modules, the latter being especially suited to develop novel applications. The SBL comes with a thorough documentation consisting of user and reference manuals, and a bugzilla platform to handle community feedback.The SBL is available from http://sbl.inria.frSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

  abstract = {{Residue coevolution within and between proteins is used as a marker of physical interaction and/or residue functional cooperation. Pairs or groups of coevolving residues are extracted from multiple sequence alignments based on a variety of computational approaches. However, coevolution signals emerging in subsets of sequences might be lost if the full alignment is considered. iBIS2Analyzer is a web server dedicated to a phylogeny-driven coevolution analysis of protein families with different evolutionary pressure. It is based on the iterative version, iBIS2, of the coevolution analysis method BIS, Blocks in Sequences. iBIS2 is designed to iteratively select and analyse subtrees in phylogenetic trees, possibly large and comprising thousands of sequences. With iBIS2Analyzer, openly accessible at http://ibis2analyzer.lcqb.upmc.fr/, the user visualizes, compares and inspects clusters of coevolving residues by mapping them onto sequences, alignments or structures of choice, greatly simplifying downstream analysis steps. A rich and interactive graphic interface facilitates the biological interpretation of the results.}},
