  abstract = {In computational structural biology, structure comparison is fundamental for our understanding of proteins. Structure comparison is, e.g., algorithmically the starting point for computational studies of structural evolution and it guides our efforts to predict protein structures from their amino acid sequences. Most methods for structural alignment of protein structures optimize the distances between aligned and superimposed residue pairs, i.e., the distances traveled by the aligned and superimposed residues during linear interpolation. Considering such a linear interpolation, these methods do not differentiate if there is room for the interpolation, if it causes steric clashes, or more severely, if it changes the topology of the compared protein backbone curves.},

  abstract = {We introduce a method of looking at, analyzing, and comparing protein structures. The topology of a protein is captured by 30 numbers inspired by Vassiliev knot invariants. To illustrate the simplicity and power of this topological approach, we construct a measure (scaled Gauss metric, SGM) of similarity of protein shapes. Under this metric, protein chains naturally separate into fold clusters. We use SGM to construct an automatic classification procedure for the CATH2.4 database. The method is very fast because it requires neither alignment of the chains nor any chain–chain comparison. It also has only one adjustable parameter. We assign 95.51\% of the chains into the proper C (class), A (architecture), T (topology), and H (homologous superfamily) fold, find all new folds, and detect no false geometric positives. Using the SGM, we display a “map” of the space of folds projected onto two dimensions, show the relative locations of the major structural classes, and “zoom into” the space of proteins to show architecture, topology, and fold clusters. The existence of a simple measure of a protein fold computed from the chain path will have a major impact on automatic fold classification.}

  abstract  = {Detection of protein structure similarity is a central challenge in structural bioinformatics. Comparisons are usually performed at the polypeptide chain level, however the functional form of a protein within the cell is often an oligomer. This fact, together with recent growth of oligomeric structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), demands more efficient approaches to oligomeric assembly alignment/retrieval. Traditional methods use atom level information, which can be complicated by the presence of topological permutations within a polypeptide chain and/or subunit rearrangements. These challenges can be overcome by comparing electron density volumes directly. But, brute force alignment of 3D data is a compute intensive search problem. We developed a 3D Zernike moment normalization procedure to orient electron density volumes and assess similarity with unprecedented speed. Similarity searching with this approach enables real-time retrieval of proteins/protein assemblies resembling a target, from PDB or user input, together with resulting alignments (http://shape.rcsb.org).},

While powerful, these approaches do not take coevolution between residues into account. Taking advantage of recent advances in the field of contact prediction, we propose here to represent proteins by Potts models, which model direct couplings between positions in addition to positional composition, and to compare proteins by aligning these models. Due to non-local dependencies, the problem of aligning Potts models is hard and remains the main computational bottleneck for their use.},

We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), designed to learn complex high-dimensional data and their statistical features, can efficiently model protein families from sequence information. We here apply RBM to 20 protein families, and present detailed results for two short protein domains (Kunitz and WW), one long chaperone protein (Hsp70), and synthetic lattice proteins for benchmarking. The features inferred by the RBM are biologically interpretable: they are related to structure (residue-residue tertiary contacts, extended secondary motifs (α-helixes and β-sheets) and intrinsically disordered regions), to function (activity and ligand specificity), or to phylogenetic identity. In addition, we use RBM to design new protein sequences with putative properties by composing and 'turning up' or 'turning down' the different modes at will. Our work therefore shows that RBM are versatile and practical tools that can be used to unveil and exploit the genotype–phenotype relationship for protein families.},

  abstract     = {Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) of homologous sequences contain information on structural and functional constraints and their evolutionary histories. Despite their importance for many downstream tasks, such as structure prediction, MSA generation is often treated as a separate pre-processing step, without any guidance from the application it will be used for. Here, we implement a smooth and differentiable version of the Smith-Waterman pairwise alignment algorithm that enables jointly learning an MSA and a downstream machine learning system in an end-to-end fashion. To demonstrate its utility, we introduce SMURF (Smooth Markov Unaligned Random Field), a new method that jointly learns an alignment and the parameters of a Markov Random Field for unsupervised contact prediction. We find that SMURF learns MSAs that mildly improve contact prediction on a diverse set of protein and RNA families. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by connecting our differentiable alignment module to AlphaFold and maximizing predicted confidence, we can learn MSAs that improve structure predictions over the initial MSAs. Interestingly, the alignments that improve AlphaFold predictions are self-inconsistent and can be viewed as adversarial. This work highlights the potential of differentiable dynamic programming to improve neural network pipelines that rely on an alignment and the potential dangers of relying on black-box methods for optimizing predictions of protein sequences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract     = {Over the last year, there have been substantial improvements in protein structure prediction, particularly in methods like DeepMind{\textquoteright}s AlphaFold2 (AF2) that exploit deep learning strategies. Here we report a new CATH-Assign protocol which is used to analyse the first tranche of AF2 models predicted for 21 model organisms and discuss insights these models bring on the nature of protein structure space. We analyse good quality models and those with no unusual structural characteristics, i.e., features rarely seen in experimental structures. For the \~{}370,000 models that meet these criteria, we observe that 92\% can be assigned to evolutionary superfamilies in CATH. The remaining domains cluster into 2,367 putative novel superfamilies. Detailed manual analysis on a subset of 618 of those which had at least one human relative revealed some extremely remote homologies and some further unusual features, but 26 could be confirmed as novel superfamilies and one of these has an alpha-beta propeller architectural arrangement never seen before. By clustering both experimental and predicted AF2 domain structures into distinct {\textquoteleft}global fold{\textquoteright} groups, we observe that the new AF2 models in CATH increase information on structural diversity by 36\%. This expansion in structural diversity will help to reveal associated functional diversity not previously detected. Our novel CATH-Assign protocol scales well and will be able to harness the huge expansion (at least 100 million models) in structural data promised by DeepMind to provide more comprehensive coverage of even the most diverse superfamilies to help rationalise evolutionary changes in their functions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {{Mutations in human proteins lead to diseases. The structure of these proteins can help understand the mechanism of such diseases and develop therapeutics against them. With improved deep learning techniques, such as RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold, we can predict the structure of proteins even in the absence of structural homologs. We modeled and extracted the domains from 553 disease-associated human proteins without known protein structures or close homologs in the Protein Databank. We noticed that the model quality was higher and the Root mean square deviation (RMSD) lower between AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold models for domains that could be assigned to CATH families as compared to those which could only be assigned to Pfam families of unknown structure or could not be assigned to either. We predicted ligand-binding sites, protein–protein interfaces and conserved residues in these predicted structures. We then explored whether the disease-associated missense mutations were in the proximity of these predicted functional sites, whether they destabilized the protein structure based on ddG calculations or whether they were predicted to be pathogenic. We could explain 80\\% of these disease-associated mutations based on proximity to functional sites, structural destabilization or pathogenicity. When compared to polymorphisms, a larger percentage of disease-associated missense mutations were buried, closer to predicted functional sites, predicted as destabilizing and pathogenic. Usage of models from the two state-of-the-art techniques provide better confidence in our predictions, and we explain 93 additional mutations based on RoseTTAFold models which could not be explained based solely on AlphaFold models.}},
