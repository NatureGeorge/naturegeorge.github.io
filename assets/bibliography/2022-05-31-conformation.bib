  abstract = {We give a review on the landscape theory of the equilibrium biological systems and landscape-flux theory of the nonequilibrium biological systems as the global driving force. The emergences of the behaviors, the associated thermodynamics in terms of the entropy and free energy and dynamics in terms of the rate and paths have been quantitatively demonstrated. The hierarchical organization structures have been discussed. The biological applications ranging from protein folding, biomolecular recognition, specificity, biomolecular evolution and design for equilibrium systems as well as cell cycle, differentiation and development, cancer, neural networks and brain function, and evolution for nonequilibrium systems, cross-scale studies of genome structural dynamics and experimental quantifications/verifications of the landscape and flux are illustrated. Together, this gives an overall global physical and quantitative picture in terms of the landscape and flux for the behaviors, dynamics and functions of biological systems.},

  abstract = {Most experimental studies on the dynamics of protein folding have been confined to timescales of 1 ms and longer. Yet it is obvious that many phenomena that are obligatory elements of the folding process occur on much faster timescales. For example, it is also now clear that the formation of secondary and tertiary structures can occur on nanosecond and microsecond times, respectively. Although fast events are essential to, and sometimes dominate, the overall folding process, with a few exceptions their experimental study has become possible only recently with the development of appropriate techniques. This review discusses new approaches that are capable of initiating and monitoring the fast events in protein folding with temporal resolution down to picoseconds. The first important results from those techniques, which have been obtained for the folding of some globular proteins and polypeptide models, are also discussed. }
