  abstract = {The energy landscape approach has played a fundamental role in advancing our understanding of protein folding. Here, we quantify protein folding energy landscapes by exploring the underlying density of states. We identify three quantities essential for characterizing landscape topography: the stabilizing energy gap between the native and nonnative ensembles δE, the energetic roughness ΔE, and the scale of landscape measured by the entropy S. We show that the dimensionless ratio between the gap, roughness, and entropy of the system  accurately predicts the thermodynamics, as well as the kinetics of folding. Large Λ implies that the energy gap (or landscape slope towards the native state) is dominant, leading to more funneled landscapes. We investigate the role of topological and energetic roughness for proteins of different sizes and for proteins of the same size, but with different structural topologies. The landscape topography ratio Λ is shown to be monotonically correlated with the thermodynamic stability against trapping, as characterized by the ratio of folding temperature versus trapping temperature. Furthermore, Λ also monotonically correlates with the folding kinetic rates. These results provide the quantitative bridge between the landscape topography and experimental folding measurements.}

  abstract  = {Proteins are responsible for most cellular functions. Naturally occurring proteins are different from random heteropolymers of amino acids since they have evolved to spontaneously fold into native structure and specifically bind with their partners. A fundamental question is how nature selects the sequences that are sculpted to be able to not only fold into native structure but also bind with functional partners. In this work, we evolve the sequences by optimizing the fitness that satisfies both folding and binding requirements. The evolved proteins manifest similar molecular-interaction patterns as naturally occurring proteins. This validates that the principle used by nature via evolution to select protein sequences is the same as the one that governs protein folding and functional binding.Most proteins have evolved to spontaneously fold into native structure and specifically bind with their partners for the purpose of fulfilling biological functions. According to Darwin, protein sequences evolve through random mutations, and only the fittest survives. The understanding of how the evolutionary selection sculpts the interaction patterns for both biomolecular folding and binding is still challenging. In this study, we incorporated the constraint of functional binding into the selection fitness based on the principle of minimal frustration for the underlying biomolecular interactions. Thermodynamic stability and kinetic accessibility were derived and quantified from a global funneled energy landscape that satisfies the requirements of both the folding into the stable structure and binding with the specific partner. The evolution proceeds via a bowl-like evolution energy landscape in the sequence space with a closed-ring attractor at the bottom. The sequence space is increasingly reduced until this ring attractor is reached. The molecular-interaction patterns responsible for folding and binding are identified from the evolved sequences, respectively. The residual positions participating in the interactions responsible for folding are highly conserved and maintain the hydrophobic core under additional evolutionary constraints of functional binding. The positions responsible for binding constitute a distributed network via coupling conservations that determine the specificity of binding with the partner. This work unifies the principles of protein binding and evolution under minimal frustration and sheds light on the evolutionary design of proteins for functions.All study data are included in the article and supporting information.},

The hierarchical organization structures have been discussed. The biological applications ranging from protein folding, biomolecular recognition, specificity, biomolecular evolution and design for equilibrium systems as well as cell cycle, differentiation and development, cancer, neural networks and brain function, and evolution for nonequilibrium systems, cross-scale studies of genome structural dynamics and experimental quantifications/verifications of the landscape and flux are illustrated.

  abstract = {Most experimental studies on the dynamics of protein folding have been confined to timescales of 1 ms and longer. Yet it is obvious that many phenomena that are obligatory elements of the folding process occur on much faster timescales. For example, it is also now clear that the formation of secondary and tertiary structures can occur on nanosecond and microsecond times, respectively. Although fast events are essential to, and sometimes dominate, the overall folding process, with a few exceptions their experimental study has become possible only recently with the development of appropriate techniques. This review discusses new approaches that are capable of initiating and monitoring the fast events in protein folding with temporal resolution down to picoseconds. The first important results from those techniques, which have been obtained for the folding of some globular proteins and polypeptide models, are also discussed. }

Optimal folding codes for associative-memory Hamiltonians based on aligned sequences are deduced.

Simulated annealing for the optimally encoded Hamiltonian generally leads to qualitatively correct structures.}
